### Work in progress:

**Informality, Inflation, and Fiscal Progressivity in Developing Countries** (with Joao Ritto).

**Abstract:** Developing economies have large informal sectors made up of small firms that avoid taxation and rely predominantly on cash. In addition, poorer households purchase a larger proportion of their consumption bundle from informal firms. We develop a general equilibrium model with a formality decision by firms and consumption bundle decision by households that jointly rationalizes these facts and calibrate it to evaluate the implications of different revenue-equivalent choices of consumption taxes and inflation for aggregate output, the size of the informal sector, and fiscal progressivity.
