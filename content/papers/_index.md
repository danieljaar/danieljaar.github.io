## Work in Progress

Self-employment as Self-insurance (Job Market Paper, *draft coming soon*)

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 0.9em;">Abstract</summary>

This paper investigates the role of microentrepreneurship as a substitute for unemployment insurance in emerging economies. Using microenterprise surveys from Latin American countries, I document that a significant proportion of microentrepreneurs—ranging from 15% to 39%—start firms because they do not find jobs. These _necessity entrepreneurs_ operate smaller, less profitable firms and experience higher income gains when transitioning to wage employment. I propose a two-sector model of occupational choice with labor market frictions, where workers can become self-employed to avoid unemployment. I calibrate the model for Mexico and show that self-insurance through self-employment decreases unemployment by 0.9 p.p. and reduces welfare losses due to unemployment risk by 22%. Consequently, enforcing costly taxes and regulations among informal microenterprises might harm workers' ability to self-insure. Despite the presence of this additional channel of insurance, introducing a non-contributory unemployment insurance system increases welfare and is strongly progressive.

Informality, Inflation, and Fiscal Progressivity in Developing Countries (with [Joao Ritto](https://joaoritto.github.io/), *draft coming soon*)

<details>
<summary style="font-size: 0.9em;">Abstract</summary>

Developing economies have large informal sectors made up of small firms that avoid taxation and rely predominantly on cash. Poorer households purchase a larger proportion of their consumption bundle from informal firms. We develop a general equilibrium model with a formality decision by firms and consumption bundle decision by households that matches these facts and calibrate it to evaluate the implications of different revenue-equivalent choices of consumption taxes and inflation for aggregate output, the size of the informal sector, and fiscal progressivity.

## Dormant

Sequential Equilibrium with Credit Constraints ([paper](/GE-incomplete-markets.pdf))
<details> 
<summary style="font-size: 0.9em;">Abstract</summary> 
<div style="font-size: 0.9em;">
	The classic result by Magill and Quinzii (1996) for incomplete market economies with
	infinitely-lived assets shows that a competitive equilibrium may not exist when debt constraints or
	transversality conditions are used to prevent Ponzi schemes. By replacing the former with credit
	constraints targeting the amount of borrowing, I determine levels of liquidity under which a competitive equilibrium always exists. Results include debt contracts with unbounded delivery streams and do not require uniform impatience, although I assume that preferences may be represented by time and state separable utility functions.
